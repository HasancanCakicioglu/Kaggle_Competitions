# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains my solution for the Titanic Kaggle competition.

## Competition Overview

The Titanic competition on Kaggle is a classic machine learning challenge where the goal is to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more. The competition provides a training dataset with labeled passenger data and a test dataset for which survival predictions need to be made.
